NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::AVAR - Use Dist::Zilla like AVAR does

DESCRIPTION
    This is the plugin bundle that AVAR uses. Use it as:

        [@AVAR]
        ;; same as `name' earlier in the dist.ini, repeated due to
        ;; limitations of the Dist::Zilla plugin interface
        dist = MyDist
        ;; If you're not avar
        github_user = imposter

    It's equivalent to:

        [@Filter]
        bundle = @Classic
        remove = PodVersion
        remove = PodTests
    
        [VersionFromPrev]
        [AutoPrereq]
        [MetaJSON]

        [MetaNoIndex]
        ;; Only added if these directories exist
        directory = inc
        directory = t
        directory = xt
        directory = utils
    
        [ReadmeFromPod]

        [MetaResources]
        ;; $github_user is 'avar' by default, $lc_dist is lc($dist)
        homepage   = http://search.cpan.org/dist/$dist/
        bugtracker = http://github.com/$github_user/$lc_dist/issues
        repository = http://github.com/$github_user/$lc_dist
        license    = http://dev.perl.org/licenses/
        Ratings    = http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/$dist
    
        [NextRelease]
        format = %-2v %{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}d
    
        [@Git]
        tag_format = %v
